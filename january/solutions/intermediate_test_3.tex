\item % Ireland 2017 P4
{\itshape Find the smallest positive integer which only has $1$ and $2$ as digits and which is divisible by $99$.}


\item % Tim
{\itshape ${\Gamma}$ is a circle and ${AB}$ and ${CD}$ are ${\perp}$ chords that intersect inside ${\Gamma}$. ${P}$ is on ${\Gamma}$, with ${Q}$ diametrically opposite to ${P}$. Let the feet of the perpendiculars from ${P}$ to ${AB}$ and ${CD}$ be ${P'}$ and ${P''}$ respectively, and the feet of the perpendiculars from ${Q}$ to ${AB}$ and ${CD}$ be ${Q'}$ and ${Q''}$ respectively. Show that: $${ (P'P)^2+(P''P)^2+(Q'Q)^2+(Q''Q)^2 < d^2}$$ where ${d}$ is the diameter of ${\Gamma}$.}

\item % Taariq
{\itshape Let $q(x) = x^3 -x^2 -2x +1$ with roots $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Find $a^2 +b^2 + c^2$.}

Since $a,b,c$ are roots and $q(x)$ has no leading coefficient, we can factorise $q(x)$ into $q(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)$. Multiplying out gives $$q(x) = x^3 + x^2(-a - b - c) + x(ab + bc + ca) - abc$$ which means that $-a -b -c = -1$ and $ab + bc + ca = -2$. The first equation is equivalent to $a + b + c = 1$. These results could've been read directly from Viviani's. We finish with the following
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= (a + b + c)^2 - 2ab -2bc -2c\\
&= (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)\\
&= 1^2 -2(-2)\\
&= 5
\end{align*}


\item % Tim
{\itshape There is a book with $n$ chapters where chapter $i$ has $i$ pages.
The probability of opening the book in the same chapter twice in a row is $p$.
Is it possible for $p$ to be $1/k$ for some integer $k$?}

Notice that the book has $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ pages ($1+2+3+...+n$). Now, the number of ways that we can land in the same chapter twice is $1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2$, since each chapter has $i$ pages that we could have landed in each time. This can be simplified as: $1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. The total number of ways to open the book twice is just $(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2$, since we can land on any page, then any page again. So $p = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}/(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 = \frac{(2n+1)}{3}/(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})=\frac{2(2n+1)}{3n(n+1)}$. Since $n(n+1)$ is always divisible by 2, the 2 on the top will cancel. Now, we seek $n$ such that $2n+1$ will cancel i.e. since $2n+1$ is odd, we seek $n$ with $2n+1\:|\: 3n(n+1)$.
\begin{align*}
2n+1\:&|\: 3n^2+3n\\
2n+1\:&|\: 2(3n^2+3n)-3n(2n+1) = 3n\\
2n+1\:&|\: 2(3n)-3(2n+1)\\
2n+1\:&|\: -3\\
\end{align*}
Finally, we get $2n+1=1,3,-1,-3$ which gives $n=0,1,-1,-2$, none of which are valid numbers of chapters. So there is no $n>1$ giving $p=\frac{1}{k}$.


\item % Ireland Book 2018 P1 (the Green one)
{\itshape Points $D$, $E$, and $F$ lie respectively on sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ of triangle $ABC$ such that $BDEF$ is a parallelogram. Prove that the area of $BDEF$ is maximal when $D$, $E$, and $F$ are the midpoints of the sides.}
