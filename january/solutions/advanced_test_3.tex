{\itshape There is a book with $n$ chapters where chapter $i$ has $i$ pages.
The probability of opening the book in the same chapter twice in a row is $p$.
Is it possible for $p$ to be $1/k$ for some integer $k$?}

We note that the book contains
\[
  1 + 2 + 3 + \dotsb + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}  
\]
pages.

To calculate the probability of opening the book in the same chapter twice, we count the number of ways to open it in the same chapter twice, and divide this by the total number of outcomes for opening the book twice.

Suppose that we initially open the book in chapter $i$. Then there are $i$ options for which page we initially opened it on, and there are $i$ ways to open it a second time in the same chapter. The total number of ways of opening it in chapter $i$ twice is thus $i^2$, and so the total number of ways of opening it in the same chapter twice is
\[
  1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \dotsb + n^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}.
\]

We see that the probability of opening it in the same chapter twice is
\[
  \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6}{(n(n + 1)/2)^2} = \frac{4(2n + 1)}{6n(n + 1)}
\]

For this to be equal to $1/k$, we require
\[
  \frac{2(2n + 1)}{3n(n + 1)} = \frac{1}{k}.
\]
Since $2n + 1$ is relatively prime to both $n$ and $n + 1$, this would require that $2n + 1 \mid 3$. (We need the $2n + 1$ in the numerator to ``cancel''.) It then follows that $n = 1$, and so it is only possible for the probability to be of the form $\frac{1}{k}$ if the book has only one chapter.

{\itshape Find all polynomials $P$ with real coefficients such that $(x + 1)P(x - 1) - (x - 1)P(x)$ is constant.}
Letting $x = 1$, we see that the constant is $2P(0)$. Thus the equation is simply
$$(x + 1)P(x - 1) - (x - 1)P(x) = 2P(0) $$
Letting $x = 0$, we get $P(-1) = P(0)$. Consider now the polynomial $Q(x) = P(x) - P(0)$. Substituting $P(x) = Q(x) + P(0)$ into the equation, we get
\begin{align*}
  (x + 1)(Q(x - 1) + P(0)) - (x - 1)(Q(x) + P(0)) &= 2P(0) \\
  \implies (x + 1)Q(x - 1) - (x - 1)Q(x) = 0
\end{align*}
Now, we know that $Q(0) = Q(-1) = 0$, so $Q$ can be written as $Q(x) = kx(x + 1)R(x)$ where $k$ is some constant, and $R(x)$ is some polynomial. Thus gives 
$$k(x + 1)(x - 1)(x)R(x - 1) - k(x - 1)(x)(x + 1)R(x) = 0 $$
which can be simplified to
$$kx(x^2 - 1)(R(x - 1) - R(x)) = 0$$
when $x(x^2 - 1) \ne 0$, we must have $R(x) = R(x - 1)$. This is true for infinitely many $x$ and since $R$ is a polynomial, we then have that $R$ must be a constant polynomial. Thus, we know that $Q$ is exactly $Q(x) = kx(x + 1)$. From here we can see that $P$ must be
$$P(x) = kx(x + 1) + c$$
so only polynomials of the form $P(x) = kx(x + 1) + c$ can satisfy the constraint.

We can then check that this does indeed satisfy the original condition:
\begin{align*}
  (x + 1)P(x - 1) - (x - 1)P(x) &= (x + 1) \cdot (k(x - 1)x + c) - (x - 1) \cdot (kx(x + 1) + c) \\
  &= kx(x^2 - 1) - kx(x^2 - 1) + c \cdot (x + 1) - c \cdot (x - 1) \\
  &= 2c
\end{align*}

\item % French NT Training Assignment 2017, Exercise 8
{\itshape Does there exist an infinite set $A$ of natural numbers such that any finite sum of distinct elements of $A$ is not a perfect power, where a perfect power is a number of the form $a^b$ with $b > 1$ and $a \in \mathbb{N}$.}

The answer is \textbf{yes}. We construct the set $A$ inductively. Let $a_0 = 2$ (or any other number that is not a perfect power).

Suppose that we have already chosen values $A_n = \{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ such that any finite sum involving only elements of $A_n$ is not a perfect power. We will choose $a_{n + 1}$ such that the same is true of $A_{n + 1} = A_n \cup \{ a_{n + 1} \}$.

Let $S$ be the set of values of all possible sums involving distinct elements of $A_n$. We are done if we can find $a_{n + 1}$ that is not a perfect power, and such that $a_{n + 1} + s$ is not a perfect power for every element $s \in S$.

Let $B$ be the largest element of $S$. (i.e. $B = a_0 + a_1 + \dotsb + a_n$) If we could find an interval $[x, x + B]$ (where $x \notin A_n$) that does not contain any perfect powers, then we could set $a_{n + 1} = x$. Then since $a_{n+1} + s$ falls in this interval for every $s \in S$, we know that $a_{n + 1} + s$ is not a perfect power for every $s \in S$.

We claim that there are in fact arbitrarily long intervals of natural numbers which do not contain any perfect powers. Let $p(N)$ be the number of perfect powers that are at most $N$. We claim that $p(N)/N$ becomes arbitrarily small as $N$ gets larger. This completes the proof, because if every interval of length $B + 1$ always contained a perfect power, then we would have
\[
  p(N) \geq \left\lfloor \frac{N}{B + 1} \right\rfloor > \frac{N}{B + 1} - 1,
\]
and so $p(N)/N$ would tend to something at least as large as $\frac{1}{B + 1}$ as $N$ tends to infinity.

We now derive an estimate for $p(N)/N$. Let $k$ be the largest natural number such that there exists a natural number $a$ such that $a^k \leq N$. Since $2^k \leq a^k \leq N$, we know that $k \leq \log_2 N$.

Since there are at most $\sqrt{N}$ perfect squares that are at most $N$, at most $\sqrt[3]{N}$ perfect cubes that are at most $N$, and so on, we see that
\[
  p(N) \leq \sqrt{N} + \sqrt[3]{N} + \sqrt[4]{N} + \dotsb + \sqrt[k]{N}
\]
and since
\[
  \sqrt[i]{N} \leq \sqrt{N}
\]
for each $i$, we obtain that
\[
  p(N) \leq k \sqrt{N} \leq \sqrt{N} \log_2 N \implies \frac{p(N)}{N} \leq \frac{\sqrt{N} \log_2 N}{N}
\]
which does indeed tend to $0$ as $N \to \infty$.
