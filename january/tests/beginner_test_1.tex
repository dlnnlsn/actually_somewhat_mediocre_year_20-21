\begin{tabular}{m{1cm} m{0.5cm} m{0.5cm} m{0.5cm}}
&T&E&N\\
+&T&W&O\\
\hline
&O&N&E\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Find, with proof, the values of T,W,O,N,E.

\item Ralph and Phil are playing a game. They have R12 in a bank account and can only withdraw coins of values R1, R2 and R5. The winner is the player who withdraws the last coin. If Ralph starts and they then alternate withdrawing one coin each (with a value of their choice), who has the winning strategy and how can they win?\\
\textit{Note: A winning strategy must be able to beat any sequence of moves that the opposing player decides to make.}


\item You are given the following shape: % South Africa, Tim's Assorted Combinatorics Questions 2020, Q2 (7 marks)

	You need to tile this with L-shapes made of 3 blocks. Which single blocks could you shade out of the original diagram to make this possible?


\item % Moldova, 61st Maths Olympiad (2017), 7.1 modified
Find all natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ satisfying 
$$x + \frac{1}{y + \frac{1}{z}} = \frac{850862}{421}$$
