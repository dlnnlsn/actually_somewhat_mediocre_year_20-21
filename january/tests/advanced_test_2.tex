\begin{enumerate}[1.]

\item % Danielle from Ukrainian MO
A positive integer $N$ has exactly $2021$ positive divisors (including $1$ and $N$ itself), and it is divisible by $2021$.
Prove that $N$ is not divisible by $2021^{43}$.


\item % Ralph: found in one of the books. Can't remember which one.
Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $x$, $y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers with $a + b + c = x + y + z$. Prove that 
$$\frac{a}{x + y} + \frac{b}{y + z} + \frac{c}{z + x} + \frac{x}{a + b} + \frac{y}{b + c} + \frac{z}{c + a} > 2 $$

\item % Ireland Book 2017 P15 (orange book)
Let circles $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ intersect at $A$ and $B$. One of the tangents to $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ touches them at $P$ and $Q$ respectively. Let line $AB$ meet the circumcircle of $PQA$ at $C$. Join $CP$ and $CQ$ and extend both to meet $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $F$ and $E$ respectively. Prove that the quadrilateral $PQFE$ is cyclic.

\item % Romania TST 2011, P12
Prove that there are infinitely many $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that there exists a $d \in \mathbb{N}$ with both $d$ and $d + n$ being factors of $n^2 + 1$.
