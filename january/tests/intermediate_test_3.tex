\begin{enumerate}[1.]

\item % Ireland 2017 P4
Find the smallest positive integer which only has $1$ and $2$ as digits and which is divisible by $99$.


\item % Tim
${\Gamma}$ is a circle and ${AB}$ and ${CD}$ are ${\perp}$ chords that intersect inside ${\Gamma}$. ${P}$ is on ${\Gamma}$, with ${Q}$ diametrically opposite to ${P}$. Let the feet of the perpendiculars from ${P}$ to ${AB}$ and ${CD}$ be ${P'}$ and ${P''}$ respectively, and the feet of the perpendiculars from ${Q}$ to ${AB}$ and ${CD}$ be ${Q'}$ and ${Q''}$ respectively. Show that: $${ (P'P)^2+(P''P)^2+(Q'Q)^2+(Q''Q)^2 < d^2}$$ where ${d}$ is the diameter of ${\Gamma}$.

\item % Taariq
Let $q(x) = x^3 -x^2 -2x +1$ with roots $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Find $a^2 +b^2 + c^2$.


\item % Tim
There is a book with $n$ chapters where chapter $i$ has $i$ pages.
The probability of opening the book in the same chapter twice in a row is $p$.
Is it possible for $p$ to be $1/k$ for some integer $k$?


\item % Ireland Book 2018 P1 (the Green one)
Points $D$, $E$, and $F$ lie respectively on sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ of triangle $ABC$ such that $BDEF$ is a parallelogram. Prove that the area of $BDEF$ is maximal when $D$, $E$, and $F$ are the midpoints of the sides.
