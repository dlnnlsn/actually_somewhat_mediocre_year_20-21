A square-based pyramid has all of its edges the same length.
A cube is placed inside so that one of its faces lies on the base of the pyramid, and the opposite face has an edge along each side of the pyramid (think -- the natural way to put a cube in a pyramid).
Show that the sum of any of the cube's edge lengths with any of the cube's face diagonal lengths is the same as the edge length of the pyramid.

There is a soccer competition with five teams where each team plays exactly one match against each other team.
If one team wins against another team, that team gets $5$ points whereas the losing team gets $0$ points.
If two teams draw, they each get $1$ point if neither team scored a goal and they each get $2$ points if they scored at least one goal.
At the end of the competition it is found that the total points for the teams form five consecutive nonnegative integers.
What is the minimum number of goals scored in this competition?
