A square-based pyramid has all of its edges the same length.
A cube is placed inside so that one of its faces lies on the base of the pyramid, and the opposite face has an edge along each side of the pyramid (think -- the natural way to put a cube in a pyramid).
Show that the sum of any of the cube's edge lengths with any of the cube's face diagonal lengths is the same as the edge length of the pyramid.
