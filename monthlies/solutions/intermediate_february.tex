{\itshape The natural number $n$ can be replaced by $ab$ if $a + b = n$, where $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers. Can the number $2021$ be obtained from $22$ after a sequence of such
replacements?}

{\itshape Prove that among the first $30000$ positive integers there are at least $22000$ composite numbers.}

Among the first $30000$ positive integers, there are $\frac{30000}{2} = 15000$ multiples of $2$, $10000$ multiples of $3$, and $6000$ multiples of $5$. There are then at most $15000 + 10000 + 6000 = 31000$ multiples of $2$, $3$, or $5$. But this counts each multiples of $6$, $10$, and $15$ twice, so we subtract the $5000 + 3000 + 2000 = 10000$ multiples of $6$, $10$, or $15$ to arrive at at least $31000 - 10000 = 21000$ multiples of $2$, $3$, or $5$. But now we have added each multiple of $30$ twice, but subtracted them $3$ times, so we add $\frac{30000}{30} = 1000$ to account for the multiples of $30$.

We thus see that among the first $30000$ positive integers, there are $22000$ that are a multiple of $2$, $3$, or $5$. These are all composite except for $2$, $3$, or $5$ themselves, so we need only find $3$ more composite numbers below $30000$ that are not divisible by any of these. The numbers $49$, $77$, and $121$ will do.

{\itshape Let $a$ and $b$ be positive real numbers such that $2a^2 +2b^2 = 5ab$.
If $|x|$ denotes the absolute value of $x$, calculate
\[ \left|\frac{a+b}{a-b}\right|. \]}

{\itshape Triangle $ABC$ is a right angled triangle with $\angle C = 90^{\circ}$. $P$ is placed randomly inside $\triangle ABC$. What is the probability that the area of $\triangle PBC$ is less than half of the area of $\triangle ABC$?

{\itshape Let $c$ and $d$ be positive divisors of a natural number $n$ such that $c > d$. Prove that $$c > d + \frac{d^2}{n}.$$}

Let $n = kc = md$. The inequality that we want to prove is then equivalent to
\[
	\frac{n}{k} > \frac{n}{m} + \frac{\frac{n^2}{m^2}}{n} \iff \frac{1}{k} > \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{m^2} \iff m^2 > mk + k.
\]
Since $c > d$, we have that $k < m$, and so $k \leq m - 1$, and so we have that
\[
	mk + k = k(m + 1) \leq (m - 1)(m + 1) = m^2 - 1 < m^2
\]
which proves the desired result.

\item % Ireland 2018 Q9
{\itshape Suppose $a,b,c > 0$ and $\sqrt{a-b} +\sqrt{a-c} > \sqrt{b+c}$. Prove that $a > \dfrac{3}{4} (b+c)$.}

Suppose that $a \leq \dfrac{3}{4} (b + c)$. We will show that $\sqrt{a-b} +\sqrt{a-c} \leq \sqrt{b+c}$. Since $a \leq \dfrac{3}{4} (b + c)$, we have that
\[
	\sqrt{a-b} +\sqrt{a-c} \leq \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}(b + c) - b} + \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}(b + c) - c} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\sqrt{3c - b} + \sqrt{3b - c}\right).
\]

We thus wish to show that
\[
	\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\sqrt{3c - b} + \sqrt{3b - c}\right)  \leq \sqrt{b + c}.
\]
By squaring both sides, this is equivalent to
\[
	(3c - b) + (3b - c) + 2\sqrt{(3c - b)(3b - c)}  \leq 4(b + c).
\]
We move the terms not under the square-root to the right hand side, divide by $2$, and square again to obtain
\[
	(3c - b)(3b - c) \leq (b + c)^2.
\]
Expanding each side of this inequality leads us to want to prove that
\[
	10bc - 3b^2 - 3c^2 \leq b^2 + 2bc + c^2
\]
which is equivalent to
\[
	4(b - c)^2 \geq 0
\]
and so we are done.
