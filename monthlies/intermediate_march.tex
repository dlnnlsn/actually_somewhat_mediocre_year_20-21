There are $n$ towns in a country.
Every road in this country goes from one of these towns to another.
Two independent routes from town $A$ to town $B$ are routes that do not both go through any other town $C$.
If we are told that there are at least two independent routes from any town $A$ to any other town $B$, what is the minimum number of roads that could be in this country?

Let $ABC$ be a triangle with centroid $G$.
$\Gamma$ is the circle with diameter $BG$ and $H$ is its centre.
Let $CG$ extended intersect $AB$ at $F$ and $\Gamma$ at $I$ different to $G$.
Let $AG$ extended intersect $BC$ at $D$ and $\Gamma$ at $J$ different to $G$. Show that $IJ$ is parallel to $FD$ if and only if $I$, $H$, and $J$ are collinear.
