\item % Inequality. #141 Bulgarian Spring Mathematics Festival 2000.
For $x,y,z > 0$, prove that
\[ \frac{x^3}{x+y} +\frac{y^3}{y+z} +\frac{z^3}{z+x} \geq \frac{xy+yz+zx}{2}. \]


\item % April 2015 Monthly
Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $x \neq 0,1$ we have
\[ f(x) +f\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right) = x. \]


\item % January 2015 Monthly 
You are given a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ such that $OA = \frac{OB.OD}{OC+CD}$, where $O$ is the intersection point of the diagonals of $ABCD$.
The circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, intersects the line $BD$ in point $Q$.
Prove that $CQ$ bisects $\angle DCA.$


\item % Number theory. Question 4, Grade 10-12, p.37, First Bulgarian Festival for young talents.
Find all triples of natural numbers $x,y,z$ such that $$7^x +13^y = 2^z.$$


\item % Geometry. #20 Bulgarian Spring Mathematics Festival 1997.
Equilateral triangle $ABC$ has an area of 7.
$M$ and $N$ are points on the sides $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, such that $AN = BM$.
Let $O$ be the intersection point of $BN$ and $CM$.
The area of triangle $BOC$ is 2.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that $MB:AB = 1:3$ or $MB:AB = 2:3$.
	\item Find the size of $\angle AOB$.
\end{enumerate}


\item % Combinatorics. #15 Bulgarian Spring Mathematics Festival 1995. 
$n$ points are given in the plane $(n > 4)$, such that no three of them are collinear.
The points are used as vertices to form more than $n$ triangles.
Show that there exist two triangles which have exactly one vertex in common.

\end{enumerate}
